2048 Test Plan

Background

The objective of this game is to merge numbered tiles until you have one tile equal to 2048. The user manipulates the game by ‘tilting’ the board up, right, down, left in direction. If two tiles are the same number and are in line with each other are moved to a direction, which will allow a ‘merge’, a new tile is formed with the value of the total of the two tiles that merged. As the game progresses and as ‘tilts’ are performed, new tiles are created and positioned at random on the board. The user will merge as many tiles and as many times as needed to make a tile with the value 2048 WITHOUT filling the board with tiles and running out of possible merges as this will end the game short.
